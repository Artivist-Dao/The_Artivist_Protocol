Build a decentralized ecosystem to empower artists, activists, and social causes. We leverage blockchain to ensure transparency, democratize governance and resource distribution, and connect creative talent and social impact.

## Purpose

Artivist Protocol is a bridge between creativity, activism, and effective philanthropy. Our aim is to provide financial recognition and sustainable support for contributors, building a transparent social impact economy where everyone can participate and be rewarded fairly.

## How to Join the Community

- **Buy “public goods” NFT:** Each NFT represents support for a specific cause or project. By acquiring, you directly fund certified NGOs and social initiatives.
- **Stake NFTs to earn Artvist_Coin:** By staking NFTs, you receive Artvist_Coin, our governance and utility token, unlocking voting rights and special benefits.

## Token

### Artvist_Coin

- **Governance:** Token holders vote on proposals and resource allocation.
- **Rewards:** Access to airdrops and exclusive benefits.
- **Bonus:** Double rewards when buying NFTs using Artvist_Coin.

## "Public Goods" NFTs

- **Definition:** Digital collectibles tied to verifiable causes and real-world impact.
- **Purpose:** Fund development and ongoing work of certified NGOs.
- **Impact:** NFT sales and staking generate traceable donations, transparent allocation, and collective decision-making on fund usage.

## NGO Certification Process

- Each NGO must mint a “ONG Certificated” NFT to be eligible for funding.
- Certification involves:
  - Legal and documental verification
  - Financial audits
  - Assessment of impact and resource management
- Only rigorously reviewed NGOs join, ensuring credibility for all supporters.
