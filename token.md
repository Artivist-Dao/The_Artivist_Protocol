# The Artivist Protocol Token

## About TAP Token (The Artivist Protocol Token)

### Introduction

The TAP token is the heart of The Artivist Protocol, a DAO created to foster the union between art and social activism. The token serves as a means for governance, funding, and rewards within our ecosystem.

### Token Distribution

The Artivist Protocol issues a total of 300 TAP tokens, which are distributed as follows:

- **100 TAP for Creator Participants:** Artists and activists who directly contribute to the ecosystem.
- **100 TAP for Investors:** Individuals or entities providing initial capital and support.
- **100 TAP for DAO Treasury:** Used to fund new projects, maintain operations, and invest in initiatives supporting our mission.

### Backing and Liquidity

#### TAP Token Backing

The backing of the TAP token is initially established at 100 Sol. This means that at launch, the liquidity pool on [Raydium](https://raydium.io/)
 will consist of 100 Sol paired with the TAP tokens available for trading.

#### How Price is Determined

The price of 1 TAP in terms of Sol is determined by the market on [Raydium](https://raydium.io/)
, an Automated Market Maker (AMM) platform. The formula used is:

\[ \text{Price of 1 TAP} = \frac{\text{Amount of Sol in Pool}}{\text{Amount of TAP in Pool}} \]

With 100 Sol and 300 TAP in the pool, the initial price of 1 TAP is approximately 0.333 Sol.

## Table of Token Distribution and Progressive Financial Details

The following table shows how the total balance in Sol for each group is affected as the protocol's backing increases, along with applicable withdrawal fees and the balance progression after fees.

| Group                            | Total Balance (in SOL and TAP) | Withdrawal Fee Rate | Estimated TAP to SOL Conversion Fee | Total Balance - Fees (100 Sol Backing) | Total Balance - Fees (1000 Sol Backing) |

Progressive Withdrawal Fee Rates:

- **100 Sol Backing:**
  - 0 to 10 Sol: 50%
  - 11 to 50 Sol: 40%
  - 51 to 70 Sol: 30%
- **1000 Sol Backing:**
  - 0 to 10 Sol: 30%
  - 11 to 50 Sol: 20%
  - 51 to 70 Sol: 10%

The total balance after fees will be calculated considering the progressive withdrawal fee rates for each backing range and the estimated conversion fee from TAP to Sol.

## Importance of Progressive Fee Structure

This progressive fee structure incentivizes long-term retention of TAP tokens and supports the financial stability of the protocol. As the protocol's backing in Sol increases, withdrawal fees decrease, offering better conditions for token holders as the protocol grows and becomes more robust.

## Withdrawal Fee Rate

The withdrawal fee rate is a percentage charged when TAP token holders decide to sell them. The fees are tiered based on the value in Sol:

- **0 to 10 Sol:** 50%
- **11 to 50 Sol:** 40%
- **51 to 70 Sol:** 30%

Note that the DAO Treasury is exempt from withdrawal fees to support continued operations and project funding.

## Importance of Fee Structure

The withdrawal fee structure was designed to encourage long-term retention of TAP tokens and support the financial stability of the protocol. Higher fees for smaller amounts incentivize holders to carefully consider before selling their tokens, thus supporting the sustainability of The Artivist Protocol ecosystem.

#### Price Fluctuations

It's important to note that this is the initial price, based on the initial liquidity of the pool. The price of TAP may vary depending on supply and demand within the liquidity pool on [Raydium](https://raydium.io/)
.

### Usage and Governance

- **Governance:** TAP holders can vote on proposals, protocol changes, and DAO fund allocation.
- **Rewards and Benefits:** Active participants may receive TAP as a reward for their contributions.

### Transactions and Fees

- **Buying TAP:** Fees are determined by [Raydium](https://raydium.io/)
 and depend on Ethereum network conditions at the time of transaction.
- **Swapping TAP for Sol:** Similarly, fees are the standard fees from [Raydium](https://raydium.io/)
.
